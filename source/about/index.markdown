I'm David. (Photo by [termie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/termie/3393743830/))

![It's me!](http://cl.ly/image/431e0y241V39/Image%202012.09.18%2010:59:13%20PM.png "It's me!")

I used to be a [rocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Zephyr). My brother and I
have also put together our share of
[tunes](http://watching-cars.com/Download.html).

Now I spend most of my time developing software in the San Francisco
startup scene. Currently, I'm working on fixing democracy with
[Votizen](https://www.votizen.com/).

I'm an active member of the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) community.
It's my weapon of choice for web development. I keep the things I tinker
with on [github](https://github.com/dgouldin/).

I really care about alternatives to copyright. You should donate
to [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.net/donate/) and the
[EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate).

I like [good chocolate](http://www.roguechocolatier.com/) and
[good coffee](http://ritualroasters.com/). I have been known to travel with a
personal stash of both. If you run into me, ask me for some. (Fair
warning: it's addictive stuff!)

I prefer to get around by bike, and I fully support the great work being done
by the [San Francisco Bicycle Coalition](http://www.sfbike.org/).

I love my amazing wife, I love God, and I love my city. Ask about any
and you're likely to get an earful.
